#  Bre-R Escape Room:fist:
## Disclaimer: 
This #VR application was developed with an intent to meet specific requirements set forth in the software engineering AR/VR specialization curriculum. This project spanned an 11-day window. That being said, all requirements for the project were met but no further maintenance or updates are to be expected. 

## THE BRE-R ESCAPE ROOM EXPERIENCE
  - Explore the room for interactable objects and maybe you'll be lucky enough to interact with the right combination to unlock the door to a whole new room with new surprises and the ultimate goal of uncovering the hidden Toastbrush Enterprises logo #shebang!!
